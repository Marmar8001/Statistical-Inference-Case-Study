# Statistical-Inference-Case-Study

There are two parts to the case study. In part A, I did the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. In Part B, I applied those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

I implemented the following concepts as I worked through the case study:

The z-statistic
The t-statistic
The Central Limit Theorem
Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
Hypothesis testing
